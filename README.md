# Big-Bask-product-recommendation-using-ML
This project implements a Market Basket Analysis for BigBasket using the Apriori Algorithm to recommend frequently bought-together products.

ðŸ“Œ Objective
To discover product association rules and generate meaningful product recommendations based on customer purchase patterns.

ðŸ§  Algorithm
We use the Apriori Algorithm from the mlxtend library to identify itemsets that frequently occur together in transactions and derive association rules from them.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains transaction records from BigBasket (e.g., GroceryStoreDataSet.csv) in the format:

ðŸ”§ How It Works
Data Preprocessing â€“ Convert transactional data into a one-hot encoded format.
Frequent Itemset Generation â€“ Use Apriori to find itemsets above a minimum support threshold.
Association Rules Mining â€“ Extract rules based on confidence and lift.
Recommendation Engine â€“ Suggest products frequently bought with the selected item(s).

ðŸ“ˆ Example Output
If a customer buys Bread, the system may recommend:
Butter (Confidence: 0.75, Lift: 1.5)
Milk (Confidence: 0.6, Lift: 1.3)
